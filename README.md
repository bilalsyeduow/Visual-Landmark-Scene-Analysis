# Visual-Landmark-Scene-Analysis
A prototype OpenCV application for detecting landmarks and faces, time-of-day classification, image quality assessment, similarity retrieval, and annotation.
# Visual Landmark and Scene Analysis Application

## 📷 Project Overview

This is a prototype Computer Vision application developed as part of the CSCI435 course.  
It processes images and video frames using **OpenCV** to analyze visual scenes in multiple ways.

Key features include:
- ✅ Detect and identify visible landmarks and human faces.
- 🌙 Classify scenes by time of day (daytime vs. nighttime).
- 📊 Assess image quality using brightness, sharpness, and histogram metrics.
- 📁 Create and expand a tagged dataset for testing and training.
- 🔗 Retrieve similar images based on feature matching.
- ✏️ Provide a simple annotation tool for user labeling and marking.
- 🗂️ Support for storing, reviewing, and comparing annotated results.
